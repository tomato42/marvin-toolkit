Test scripts for OpenSSL both with and without support for implicit rejection.

OpenSSL *with* implicit rejection
=================================
If tested OpenSSL implements implicit rejection the length of the decrypted
ciphertext can leak (as it's not a proxy for the 0 byte in the decrypted
value). As such we need to generate ciphertexts that always decrypt to
a message of the same length.

Usage
-----
Run `step0.sh`, `step1.sh` as normal. Instead of running `step2.sh` run
the `step2-marvin.sh` script.

Compile this reproducer:
```
gcc -o time_decrypt time_decrypt.c -lcrypto
```

Execute it against one of the `pms_values.bin` files, for example the one
for 2048 bit key:
```
./time_decrypt_legacy -i rsa2048_repeat/pms_values.bin \
-o rsa2048_repeat/raw_times.bin -k rsa2048/pkcs8.pem -n 256
```

Convert the captured timing information to a format understandable by
the analysis script:
```
PYTHONPATH=tlsfuzzer marvin-venv/bin/python3 tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/extract.py \
-l rsa2048_repeat/log.csv --raw-times rsa2048_repeat/raw_times.bin \
-o rsa2048_repeat/ \
--binary 8 --endian little --clock-frequency 2712.003
```
The `--clock-frequency` is the TSC frequency, as reported by the kernel on
my machine:
```
[    1.506811] tsc: Refined TSC clocksource calibration: 2712.003 MHz
```
Specifying it is optional, but then the analysis will interpret clock
ticks as seconds so interpretation of the results and graphs in terms of
CPU clock cycles will be more complex.

**Warning:** None of the clock sources used by the `time_decrypt_legacy.c`
actually run at the same frequency as the CPU frequency! Remember to specify
`--endian big` when running on s390x!

Finally, run the analysis:
```
PYTHONPATH=tlsfuzzer marvin-venv/bin/python3 tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/analysis.py \
-o rsa2048_repeat/ --verbose
```


OpenSSL *without* implicit rejection
====================================
Test harness for OpenSSL *without* implicit rejection a.k.a Marvin workaround.

Usage
-----

Run `step0.sh`, `step1.sh` as normal. Instead of running `step2.sh` run
the `step2-alt.sh` script.

Compile this reproducer:
```
gcc -o time_decrypt_legacy time_decrypt_legacy.c -lcrypto
```

Execute it against one of the `ciphers.bin` files, for example the one
for 2048 bit key:
```
./time_decrypt_legacy -i rsa2048_repeat/ciphers.bin \
-o rsa2048_repeat/raw_times.bin -k rsa2048/pkcs8.pem -n 256
```

Convert the captured timing information to a format understandable by
the analysis script:
```
PYTHONPATH=tlsfuzzer marvin-venv/bin/python3 tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/extract.py \
-l rsa2048_repeat/log.csv --raw-times rsa2048_repeat/raw_times.bin \
-o rsa2048_repeat/ \
--binary 8 --endian little --clock-frequency 2712.003
```
The `--clock-frequency` is the TSC frequency, as reported by the kernel on
my machine:
```

-o rsa2048_repeat/ --verbose
```

OpenSSL with the OAEP padding
=============================
Test harness for OpenSSL for the OAEP decryption.

Usage
-----
Run `step0.sh`, `step1.sh` as normal. Instead of running `step2.sh` run
the `step2-oaep-alt.sh` script.

Compile this reproducer:
```
gcc -o time_decrypt_OAEP time_decrypt_OAEP.c -lcrypto
```

Execute it against one of the `ciphers.bin` files, for example the one
for 2048 bit key:
```
./time_decrypt_OAEP -i rsa2048_oaep_repeat/ciphers.bin \
-o rsa2048_oaep_repeat/raw_times.bin -k rsa2048/pkcs8.pem -n 256
```

Convert the captured timing information to a format understandable by
the analysis script:
```
PYTHONPATH=tlsfuzzer marvin-venv/bin/python3 tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/extract.py \
-l rsa2048_oaep_repeat/log.csv --raw-times rsa2048_oaep_repeat/raw_times.bin \
-o rsa2048_oaep_repeat/ \
--binary 8 --endian little --clock-frequency 2712.003
```

Interpretation of results
=========================

Detailed information about produced output is available in
[tlsfuzzer documentation](https://tlsfuzzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timing-analysis.html)
but what's most important is in the summary:
```
Sign test mean p-value: 0.5538, median p-value: 0.562, min p-value: 0.06575
Friedman test (chisquare approximation) for all samples
p-value: 0.9617988327160067
Worst pair: 8(valid_246), 11(zero_byte_in_padding_48_4)
Mean of differences: -2.59050e-07s, 95% CI: -4.24877e-06s, 3.403219e-06s (±3.826e-06s)

```

The Friedman test p-value specifies how confident is the test in presence of
side channel (the smaller the p-value the more confidant it is, i.e. a
p-value of 1e-6 means 1 in a million chance that there isn't a side-channel).
The other important information are the 95% Confidence Intervals reported,
they specify how sensitive is the script (in this case it's unlikely that
it would be able to detect a side channel smaller than 4.821e-08s or 48ns).

Bonus: combined RSA and AES-CBC decryption *without* implicit rejection
=======================================================================

Typical use-cases for RSA encryption are encryption of the AES key
for bulk encryption.

The `time_rsa_aes.c` is an example script that does that in side-channel
free way even with OpenSSL *without* implicit rejection.

To execute it, run the `step0.sh` and `step1.sh` as normal.
Then create the ciphertexts for the test using the `rsa-aes.sh` script.
Note, it uses rsa1024 by default (as we've already tested that
PKCS#1 v1.5 depadding works in side channel free manner above, we're
just interested in the general valid and invalid padding messages, without
differentiation on types of invalid PKCS#1 v1.5 padding).

Compile the test harness:
```
gcc -O3 -ggdb2 -o time_rsa_aes time_rsa_aes.c -lcrypto
```

Run the test harness:
```
./time_rsa_aes -i rsa1024aes128_repeat/ciphers.bin \
-o rsa1024aes128_repeat/raw_times.bin -k rsa1024/key.pem -n 128 -a 256
```
The `-n` option has the same meaning as in the normal script: size of
RSA ciphertext in bytes, it must match the size of used key.
The `-a` option specifies the size of the AES ciphertext in bytes,
it must match the size specified using the `-l` parameter to `rsa-aes-gen.py`
script.

Extraction, analysis, and interpretation of the results is the same.
